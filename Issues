# Added ssh to EC2 instance to debug the issue.

# PHP version is 7.2.34
So all the commands starting with  mysql needs to be replaced with mysqli coz mysli was deprecated after PHP5 

# rds-write-config.PHP
1. mysql_select_db ( connection, dbname) requires connection string
2. command to create table requires change -> there should be no gap between -p and password
3. Further...after connecting to the database, the program writes the input values to read.conf.php files using fopen() function.
TO write into the file..it must have write permission, so did
chmod 666 on read.conf.php file

# rds-read-data.php
1. Change mysql to mysqli
2. Save the connection to a variable -->  $conn = mysqli_connect($RDS_URL, $RDS_user, $RDS_pwd) or die(mysqli_error());
3. Change mysql_select_db(db)  to mysqli_select_db($conn, db)
4. When edit,delete,retrieving data we need to pass $conn ie. mysqli_query($conn, connection string)
